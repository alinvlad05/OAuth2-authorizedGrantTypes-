# OAuth2-authorizedGrantTypes-
In Spring Security OAuth2, the authorizedGrantTypes attribute specifies the grant types that are allowed for a client when requesting access tokens. The available options for the authorizedGrantTypes attribute are:

authorization_code: This grant type is used for web-based applications where the client redirects the user to the authorization server for authentication, and then the authorization server redirects back to the client with an authorization code.

password: This grant type is used when the client collects the user's username and password and sends them directly to the authorization server to obtain an access token. This is typically used for trusted clients and is not recommended for public clients.

implicit: This grant type is used for single-page applications or mobile apps where the client requests an access token directly from the authorization server without going through a server-side component.

client_credentials: This grant type is used when the client itself is the resource owner, and it requests an access token from the authorization server based on its own credentials (client ID and client secret).

refresh_token: This grant type is used to obtain a new access token using a refresh token that was previously issued. It allows clients to maintain access without requiring the user to re-authenticate.

urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:jwt-bearer: This grant type is used when the client presents a JWT (JSON Web Token) as a credential to obtain an access token.

Custom grant types: You can define custom grant types if needed for specific authentication and authorization scenarios.

The choice of grant type depends on the specific requirements and security considerations of your application. Each grant type has its own use cases and security implications, so it's important to choose the one that best fits your application's needs.
